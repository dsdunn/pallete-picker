# Palette Picker

Palette Picker generates and saves color palettes by project. This project served as a refresher in vanilla JS, JQuery, and CSS in module 4 of the Turing School of Software and Design front-end curriculum. Challenges for me included designing a clean and attractive layout, while maintaining solid, reliable functionality.

## Getting Started

To get the app up and running, enter the following commands in the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/dsdunn/pallete-picker
cd pallete-picker
npm install
npm start
```

## Running the tests

The testing suite is built with Enzyme and Jest. To run:

```
npm test
```
